# Your rule content

When creating or modifying CSS files, always include detailed explanatory comments for each selector and property. Each selector should have a block comment explaining its purpose, and each property should have an inline comment describing its specific visual or functional effect. Follow the pattern of '/* Selector purpose / .selector { property: value; / property effect explanation / }'
